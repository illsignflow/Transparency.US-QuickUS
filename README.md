--This foundation is setup to show the different uses of
--modals and scalable vector graphics (SVGs) in hopes of  
--linking to a database for later use.

--The build was successful in testing and is now ready for
--its next step in development

--This code is very useful for someone who wants to see different
--hover options for SVGs and making them direct to an element
--upon clicking them

--There is minimal CSS within the file
